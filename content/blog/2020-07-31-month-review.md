## Read
Looking to add mode adventure to my life I fount these two personal sites.
- [Beau Miles](https://beaumiles.com): A most charismatic and fascinating person. A trail runner, adventurer, film maker, barn builder, to name a few of his endeavours. He has had some amazing adventures with a kayak, and has made award winning films about adventures, big and small.
- [Like a big foot](http://likeabigfoot.com): A blog about inspiration and adventure with a lovely friendly tone. There is also a podcast.

While the type of adventures these two guys have had differ immensely, they both have an infectious passion. I also discovered two, adventure / running, podcasts and I am slowly working back through the backlog.

- [Like a Bigfoot](http://likeabigfoot.com): A joyful, lovely podcast about adventure and ultra running. [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/like-a-bigfoot/id1160773293?mt=2) [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/chris-ward-126531464)
- [Uphill Athlete](https://www.uphillathlete.com/podcast/) A podcast from the uphill athlete people. Interesting and informative.
