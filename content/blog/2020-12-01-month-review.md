## Read
**The Three Body Problem** by Liu Cixin. A brilliant hard SciFi book that, unbeknown to me, starts a trilogy. Definitely worth your time.

## Watch
- **The Expense Series 1** This is a rare case in which the series is actually more enjoyable than the book. I do feel that having read the first book in the series does give the season more depth. As the story progress beyond the first book, I wonder if the overal feeling will change.
- **A million ways to die in the West** A Mel Brooks movie like humor. Light entertainment. Charlize Theron is, as always, spectactualr.
- **Homecoming Season 1** A good thriller. Great camera work. Good sound engineering.
