## Book
One of the things I hope will improve by doing a monthly review is the amount of books I am reading.

** Finding Ultra** Rich Roll's book. His story is inspiration and it was intresting to read. At least the first half. The second half was moving more and more in the direction of his diet, which is somewhat less inspirational.


Thats it. It has been a slow month, with the renovation and all. Here is hoping that September will be better.
